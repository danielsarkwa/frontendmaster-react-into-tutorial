Got it! Let me tailor the README.md specifically for your learning journey and the demo you’re creating. Here’s a revised version of the README to reflect that:

FrontendMaster React Intro Tutorial - Learning Journey

This repository is part of my journey to learn React through the FrontendMaster React Intro course. It contains the demo projects and exercises I’ve built while following the course.
